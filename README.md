# Andrey Vega Alfaro Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio website. Here you can find information about my projects, papers, blog posts, and how to contact me.

## About Me

I am Andrey Vega Alfaro, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Carrot and Beet Lab. Also known as the [Goldman Lab](https://goldman.horticulture.wisc.edu/). I am originally from Costa Rica and I recently completed my PhD in Plant Breeding and Plant Genetics. I am also a founding member of 'Semillas Ticas,' a start-up focused on breeding high-quality vegetables for specialty market classes, particularly for Central America.
In my free time I collect postcards, mail stamps and enjoy Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
